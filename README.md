To test software, please run "script_imagerie_topo_linear_array.m"

The first option "Option_imaging" allows you to choose between 3 different implementations of the Fast Topological Imaging method:

% 1: First generation FTIM     G=UxV         
[S. Rodriguez et al., Ultrasonics 52, 1010–1018, 2012, 10.1016/j.ultras.2012.08.002]

% 2: Fourier-based simulation  G=omega^2xUxV 
[S. Rodriguez et al., Ultrasonics 54, 1880–1890, 2014, 10.1016/j.ultras.2013.10.001]

% 3: matricial FTIM            G=UxV         
[S. Rodriguez et al., Ultrasonics 68, 8–16, 2016, 10.1016/j.ultras.2016.02.002]
% NB: Option 3 is more RAM-demanding
